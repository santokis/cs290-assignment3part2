Task:	Started off the day by spending an hour to complete the html file that displays the number of gist pages, the favorites div, and results div. Next, watched lecture videos, researched javascript/domâ€™s online, and read discussion posts begin work on js file. By early afternoon was finished outlining getList and printList functions. Ran into problems when attempting to construct url, ended up referencing lecture video for code. Tried to work through language filters but was unable to implement in time.
